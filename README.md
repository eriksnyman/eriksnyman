Hi I'm @eriksnyman
I'm Interested in learing more about winget, powershell scripting and ant-malwre, spyware and trojans.
I'm currently not actively learning, but would like to broaden my knowledge of powershell scripting, anti-malware, spyware, trojans and enjoy winget quite a bit. She is such an easy to use companion.
I'm not sure if i will be of much use in collabaration but im willing to try
